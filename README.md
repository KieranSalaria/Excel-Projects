# Excel-Projects

This repository documents my Week 1 Excel work completed as part of a Data Technician bootcamp. The workbook focuses on developing core spreadsheet and data analysis skills through hands-on tasks using real-world style datasets.

Across the exercises, I worked with structured sales data to clean, analyse, and summarise information using Excel’s analytical tools. The projects demonstrate my ability to explore datasets, identify patterns, and communicate insights clearly using pivot tables, formulas, and basic visualisations.

Key tasks included analysing bike sales data across multiple countries, age groups, and genders to identify profitable markets, as well as summarising product sales performance by county using pivot tables and logical functions. These exercises strengthened my confidence in working with data methodically and drawing meaningful conclusions from raw information.

This project represents my foundation in Excel-based data analysis and serves as a starting point for more advanced analysis, dashboards, and automation work later in the course.

## Key Topics & Skills Demonstrated

### 1. Pivot Tables for Sales Analysis

**What I worked on:**
I used Pivot Tables to analyse bike sales data across multiple dimensions, including country, market, age group, and gender. This allowed me to summarise large datasets efficiently and compare performance across different segments.

**Skills learned:**

* Creating and configuring Pivot Tables from raw datasets
* Grouping and filtering data to answer specific business questions
* Comparing sales performance across regions and demographics
* Identifying highest and lowest performing segments
* Extracting actionable insights from summarised data

### 2. Data Analysis & Insight Generation

**What I worked on:**
Using the outputs from Pivot Tables, I analysed the data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies, such as the most profitable markets and underperforming regions.

**Findings**

* Germany had the most customers in the male and female adult markets.
* Austrailia and the UK had sales in ALL markets, with Australia having more sales overall.
* Adults were the most profitable age group, while females were the most profitable gender.
* The USA was the most profitable country, with the most sales in any one region coming from adult women there.
* A majority of the countries had no sales from young adults.
* Canada saw the fewest sales, and only from young adults.

**Skills learned:**

* Interpreting numerical outputs rather than just generating them
* Identifying trends and outliers within sales data
* Drawing conclusions from data and supporting them with evidence
* Communicating findings clearly through written reflections
* Thinking analytically about business performance

### 3. Logical Functions & Data Categorisation (SWITCH)

**What I worked on:**
I applied the SWITCH function to categorise product sales volumes into logical groups (High, Medium, Low), improving readability and enabling quicker comparisons across products and regions.

**Skills learned:**

* Writing and applying logical Excel formulas
* Using conditional logic to categorise numerical data
* Understanding how formulas scale across datasets
* Improving dataset clarity for analysis and reporting
* Reducing manual classification through automation

### 4. Product & Regional Performance Analysis

**What I worked on:**
I analysed product sales performance across different counties in England by combining Pivot Tables with categorised sales data.

**Findings**
* Durham saw the fewest total sales, with no smartphone sales whatsoever; the only other county with the latter distinction was Cornwall.
* Essex is the only county that saw no laptop sales, which were otherwise the most sold product.
* Printers sales occured only in three counties: Conrwall, Durham and Essex.
* None of the regions saw sales in all three product types simultaneously.

**Skills learned:**

* Summarising product performance by geographic region
* Comparing multiple products within a single Pivot Table
* Identifying high-performing and low-performing product categories
* Understanding how regional data impacts business decisions

### 5. Data Visualisation & Chart Exploration

**What I worked on:**
I explored Excel’s charting tools to visualise sales data, making trends and comparisons easier to understand at a glance.

**Skills learned:**

* Selecting appropriate chart types for different datasets
* Translating numerical data into visual formats
* Improving clarity and readability through formatting
* Using visuals to support analytical conclusions

## Tools & Techniques Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
* Logical functions (SWITCH, IF)
* Sorting and filtering datasets
* Spreadsheet structuring and formatting for readability

## Key Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience analysing sales data across multiple dimensions
* Improved accuracy and efficiency when working with formulas and references
* Developed an analytical mindset when approaching unfamiliar datasets
* Learned how to summarise complex data into clear, decision-ready insights
