# Excel-Projects

This repository documents my Week 1 Excel work completed as part of a Data Technician bootcamp. The workbook focuses on developing core spreadsheet and data analysis skills through hands-on tasks using real-world style datasets.

Across the exercises, I worked with structured sales data to clean, analyse, and summarise information using Excel’s analytical tools. The projects demonstrate my ability to explore datasets, identify patterns, and communicate insights clearly using pivot tables, formulas, and basic visualisations.

Key tasks included analysing bike sales data across multiple countries, age groups, and genders to identify profitable markets, as well as summarising product sales performance by county using pivot tables and logical functions. These exercises strengthened my confidence in working with data methodically and drawing meaningful conclusions from raw information.

This project represents my foundation in Excel-based data analysis and serves as a starting point for more advanced analysis, dashboards, and automation work later in the course.
