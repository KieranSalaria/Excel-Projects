# Excel-Projects

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Excel projects completed during the first week of my bootcamp course. The focus of this week was to build a strong foundation in Microsoft Excel, developing essential skills for data handling, analysis, and presentation.

The projects demonstrate my ability to work with structured datasets, apply core Excel functions, and transform raw data into clear, meaningful insights. Each file reflects practical exercises designed to mirror real-world data tasks and improve accuracy, efficiency, and confidence when working with spreadsheets.

## Skills & Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Data cleaning and organisation
* Spreadsheet formatting and layout design
* Logical thinking and problem-solving
* Attention to detail and data accuracy

## Topics Covered

* Basic Excel navigation and worksheet management
* Data entry best practices
* Cell referencing (relative, absolute, and mixed)
* Common formulas and functions (e.g. SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, IF)
* Sorting and filtering data
* Basic data validation
* Creating and formatting tables
* Introductory charts and visualisation
* Improving readability and usability of spreadsheets

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Track my progress throughout the bootcamp
* Showcase foundational Excel skills to employers and collaborators
* Build a reference point for future data and analytics projects**## Project Summary

This repository documents my Week 1 Excel work completed as part of a Data Technician bootcamp. The workbook focuses on developing core spreadsheet and data analysis skills through hands-on tasks using real-world style datasets.

Across the exercises, I worked with structured sales data to clean, analyse, and summarise information using Excel’s analytical tools. The projects demonstrate my ability to explore datasets, identify patterns, and communicate insights clearly using pivot tables, formulas, and basic visualisations.

Key tasks included analysing bike sales data across multiple countries, age groups, and genders to identify profitable markets, as well as summarising product sales performance by county using pivot tables and logical functions. These exercises strengthened my confidence in working with data methodically and drawing meaningful conclusions from raw information.

This project represents my foundation in Excel-based data analysis and serves as a starting point for more advanced analysis, dashboards, and automation work later in the course.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Data cleaning and organisation
* Pivot Tables for data summarisation and comparison
* Logical formulas and functions (including IF and SWITCH)
* Categorising and segmenting data based on conditions
* Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in datasets
* Interpreting sales performance by region, demographic, and product
* Basic data visualisation and chart exploration
* Translating data findings into clear written insights

## Tools & Techniques Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
* Logical functions (SWITCH, IF)
* Sorting and filtering datasets
* Spreadsheet structuring and formatting for readability

## Key Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience analysing sales data across multiple dimensions
* Improved accuracy and efficiency when working with formulas and references
* Developed an analytical mindset when approaching unfamiliar datasets
* Learned how to summarise complex data into clear, decision-ready insights
